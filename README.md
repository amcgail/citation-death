# A study of death and demographics, of citation attributes

I'm just going to test this what do you do now? 

This study hinges on the analogy between the historical number of citations through time, and the life course of a person. 

In it I define death and rebirth, and produce basic demographic plots for arbitrary attributes of a citation. This study looks at web of science for sociology in particular.
